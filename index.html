I completed my PhD in July 2024 from Sorbonne Université,
working in the [Sciences et Technologies de la Musique et du Son (STMS)](https://www.stms-lab.fr/) lab at [IRCAM](https://www.ircam.fr/),
under the supervision of [Rémi Mignot](https://www.ircam.fr/person/remi-mignot) and [Axel Roebel](https://www.ircam.fr/person/axel-roebel).
I also obtained a MsC in Engineering from [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) back in 2020.

I'm currently looking for a position in deep Learning for assisting the music creation process.

Besides doing research, I enjoy making music on guitar and piano, practicing karate and playing a certain [TCG](https://ygoprodeck.com/deck/bystial-centur-ion-539540).
