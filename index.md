I'm currently looking for a postdoc position in machine learning for assisting the music creation and production process.

I completed my Ph.D. in July 2024 from Sorbonne Université, working in the
  [Sciences et Technologies de la Musique et du Son (STMS)](https://www.stms-lab.fr/) lab at
  [IRCAM](https://www.ircam.fr/), under the supervision of
  [Rémi Mignot](https://www.ircam.fr/person/remi-mignot) and
  [Axel Roebel](https://www.ircam.fr/person/axel-roebel).
I also obtained a MsC in Engineering from [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) back in 2020.

My research interests include audio synthesis and generation, symbolic music processing, multimodal modeling and signal processing inclusion in deep learning frameworks.

Besides doing research, I enjoy making music on guitar and piano, practicing karate and playing a certain [TCG](https://ygoprodeck.com/deck/bystial-centur-ion-539540).
